# Visual Graph Drawing Project - TEAM 03 - DIGR

## Overview
This project implements a graph data structure and related algorithms with a graphical user interface. It allows users to create, manipulate, and analyze graphs interactively.

## Features
- Create and edit vertices and edges
- Drag and drop vertices
- Zoom in/out and pan the graph view
- Run Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path
- Save and load graph configurations
- Change edge colors
- Toggle between directed and undirected graphs
- Adjust vertices to a grid

## Files
- `MyForm.h`: Contains the user interface code using Windows Forms
- `Edge.h`: Defines the Edge class for the graph
- `Graph.cpp`: Implements the graph algorithms
- `Graph.h`: Contains the Graph class definition
- `Vertex.h`: Defines the Vertex class (inferred from includes)

## Dependencies
- Windows Forms (System::Windows::Forms)
- .NET Framework
